# Used in bot.py for sending responses to users.
# Keya (e.g., "hello") are used in code, values are message texts to be sent to users.
# Formatting: Markdown (*bold*, _italic_) to improve readability.
# Instructions for configurators:
# 1. Edit the message text while preserving the keys (e.g., "hello", "try2").
# 2. Do not delete or rename keys, otherwise the bot will not find the message.
# 3. After making changes, save the file and restart the bot or use the /update_config command.
# 4. Test changes by sending a test chat join request.
